# Awesome JS/TS

Here I would share with you all sort of awesome things about TS/JS. E.g. Regex, closure, etc

# How to test it:

1. `npm ci` or `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`
2. **Optional**: Install 3rd party libs necessary for Cypress `pacman -S gtk2 gtk3 alsa-lib xorg-server-xvfb libxss nss libnotify`.
3. To run:
   1. Unit tests: `pnpm run test:watch`.
   2. E2E tests: `pnpm run cy:open`.

An on going process to keep an up to date and complete list - Obviously as much as it is possible - Regex for almost every thing.
